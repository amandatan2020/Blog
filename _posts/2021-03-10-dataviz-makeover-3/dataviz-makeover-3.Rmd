# The Data Visualisation

The South-east Asia Armed Conflict Analysis is a data visualisation created to reveal spatio-temporal patterns of armed conflict in selected South-east Asia countries between 2015-2020. The link to the interactive visualisation can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/South-eastAsiaArmedConflictAnalysis/South-eastAsiaArmedConflictAnalysis?:language=en&:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link).

# (a) Critique of current visualisation

There are three evaluation criteria in this critique: (i) clarity; (ii) aesthetics; and (iii) interactivity. Each criterion will be discussed individually, and discussion points that cut across criterion will be placed with the main criterion that it falls under, with highlights on how the other criteria are affected.

## Clarity

### 1) Good choice of chart types

The choice of map to show the location of armed conflict events, encoded by colour and shape to differentiate the different types of armed conflict events, is good as the audience can perceive location together with distance on a map better and other patterns of the data can also surface with the use of the colour and shape scales.

The line graphs are also appropriate to show the trend of armed conflict events over time.

### 2) Unable to see data points clearly when clustered together on the map

In areas with high number and variety of armed conflict events, the data points on the map overlap. As the data points are opaque with no borders, this results in two issues, discussed below.

#### A) Difficulty in identifying the number of data points of the same colour

The main purpose of the map is to show the location of armed conflict events. In locations with high number of events, the map would provide the intensity of events, depicted by the number of data points in the area. As seen from the diagram below, it is difficult to differentiate the data points of the same colour as they form one big mass due to the lack of borders or outlines. This reduces the clarity on the number of armed conflict events happening within the area.

![Data points form masses due to lack of outlines](critique/c2a.jpg)

#### B) Unable to tell if there are any data points (and its colour) covered by the data point at top layer

At the country level (zoomed-out view), the overlapping of the opaque data points causes those data points at the bottom layers to be obscured by the data points at the top layer, as shown in the diagram below. As such, the audience has no clarity on the other types of armed conflict events that occur within the area.

![Data points at top layer obscuring data points at bottom layers](critique/c2b.jpg)

Another problem that the opaque data point causes is that the audience is unable to tell the name of the area when the data points occur where the names of the area are placed. In the diagram below, the word "Myanmar" could hardly be seen although we could argue that the general public could still make out the word "Myanmar" due to familiarity. However, if we go down to the division/state/region level, one who is not familiar with the Myanmar system would not be able to make out the names of the divisions/states/regions that are fully/partially obscured by the data points, e.g. "Chin" and "Naypyitaw" in the diagram below.

![Data points at top layer obscuring data points at bottom layers](critique/c2c.jpg)

### 3) Information in map data point tooltip not useful

In the interactive version of the visualisation, a tooltip (see diagram below) is shown when mousing over each data point on the map. The *Event Id Cnty* shows the individual event identifier by number and country acronym; the *Event Type* shows the type of armed conflict event; and the *Latitude* and *Longitude* show the latitude and longitude of the location respectively. The *Event Id Cnty*, *Latitude* and *Longitude* are very specific and too detailed, which does not value-add in the understanding of spatio-temporal patterns of armed conflict in the area.

![Tooltip information not useful](critique/c3.jpg)

### 4) Issues with y-axis range in line graphs

The line graphs are small multiples, showing manageable chunks of information in a single view. This makes it clean and easy to view and compare the data patterns. However, the range of each y-axis differs across the different line graphs, and the y-axis does not start at zero. This causes the audience to focus on the patterns and overlook the actual numbers, and misleads the audience into thinking that the patterns give a good representation of the values. To illustrate the point, let us take a closer look at the line graphs for Protests and Strategic developments. 

![Line graphs for *Protests* and *Strategic developments* event types](critique/c4.jpg)

The number of Protests in 2020 decreased drastically from 2019, whereas the number of Strategic developments has seen a steady increase from past years. The graph patterns seem to indicate that Strategic development has a much higher number of events than Protests, and that the number of Protests is close to zero, but it is not so when we compare the values! In 2020, the number of Protests is about 125-130, and the number of Strategic development events is about 150.

### 5) Order of event types in line graphs not intuitive

At first glance, the order in which the line graphs are arranged vertically is not clear, a result of different ranges in the line graphs as discussed earlier. Upon a closer look, the sort icon in the x-axis indicates that the line graphs are sorted in descending order. However, this is still not apparent from the line graphs themselves, and require the audience to trace the number of events across line graphs in order to understand the sorting.

![Line graphs sorted in descending order](critique/c5.jpg)

### 6) Different data aggregation does not support spatio-temporal analysis

The map view shows the **spatio patterns** of armed conflicts as a **total of the six years**, whereas the line graphs show the **temporal patterns** of the **annual number** of armed conflicts **over the six years**. As the data aggregation is different, the audience is unable to draw the relationship between the spatio pattern and temporal pattern of the data from the visualisation, i.e. cannot tell what is the trend of armed conflict events over time of a specific region of the country.

![Different data aggregation in the two views](critique/c6.jpg)

## Aesthetics

### 1) Issues with shape encoding on map

There is shape encoding in the map visualisation, however, the size of the data points is too small for the audience to make out the shape unless one scrutinises the data points or has a sharp eye for details. The size of the data points remain unchanged even after zooming in.

![Size of data points too small to see the shape](critique/a1.jpg)

From the diagram above, we can see that there is no legend to inform on the shape encoding. It is not clear what is being encoded by the shape. In addition, there is no differentiation in the data point tooltip information for the audience to make a guess at what the shape encodes. This reduces the clarity of the shape aesthetic.

![Tooltip for blue square data point](critique/a1square.jpg){width=60%}

### 2) Good amount of non-data ink for the line graphs

There is a good amount of non-data ink for the line graphs, making the design clean and easy to read.

As the graph titles are usually placed at the top or bottom of graphs, the label *Event Type* at the top of the graphs direct the audience to where the title actually is. Putting the graph titles at the side also allows for easier vertical comparison of the data without any visual interruption, but we could also argue that the eye needs to go left and right in order to identify which line graph is for which event type.

![*Event Type* label shows where the graph titles are](critique/a2a.jpg)

On the other hand, the label *Event Date* may be misleading as only the year component of the event dates are shown in the x-axis. As the x-axis labels are only at the bottom, it is a relatively long distance to trace between the first graph at the top to the x-axis labels to identify the corresponding year for each data point in the line graphs. It would be better if *Event Date* is replaced with year labels repeated  at top. There is no need for the *Year* x-axis title as it will be intuitive that year is being represented on the x-axis with the labels themselves.

![*Event Date* label not necessary as x-axis labels is able to show that year ie being depicted](critique/a2b.jpg)

The y-axis titles for the line graphs do not provide value to the audience as it refers to a *Sheet1* that the audience have no idea about and no access to. Furthermore, the y-axis title is orientated vertically and is repeated for each line graph, which makes it hard to read and does not value-add in understanding what the line graphs are plotted against.

![Difficult to understand and read y-axis titles](critique/a2c.jpg)

### 3) Colour scale not employed across graphs

The map uses colour to encode the event type (mapping shown in the legend on the right), however the line graph uses the same colour blue as *Battles* in the map, for all the event types. Furthermore, colour perception is more powerful and efficient than reading and understanding textual description, i.e. graph titles. This means that the audience would need to work harder in linking and de-linking colours, and  reading the graph titles, when switching between the map and line graphs.

### 4) Position of colour legend too far from map

As the colour scales are only used in the map, the audience need to trace horizontally across the entire visualisation to refer to the colour legend. The legend should be placed appropriately near to where the colour scale is used for the audience to have easy reference.

## Interactivity

### 1) Different views allowing multi-dimensional analysis

The visualisation shows two different views of the data on screen: map and line graphs. This allows for user interaction with the two graphs and easy comparison of data between the two views (though limited, as discussed earlier under the clarity criterion). 

### 2) Limited interactive capabilities

Both views provide navigation to view low-level detail (i.e. tooltip information) and selection functions (pointer and drag-box) to highlight data points of interest. There is a filter function to allow analysis of the data by country of interest and users are also able to highlight data by event types. The map view provides basic map interaction such as zoom, pan and added selection functions of radial and lasso selections. The line graphs view has the sorting function, which was discussed earlier under the clarity criterion. 

![Interactive tools shown in the visualisation](critique/i2.jpg)

The features and usability of the interactivity will be discussed in more detail next.

#### A) Added tooltip with drag-box selection not useful for map view

![Tooltip information for drag-box selection does not make sense](critique/i2a.jpg)

With the selection of a set of data points, the user is able to mouse over to view the tooltip information of the selected points. The plus point is that there is an option to access the data of the selected data points, and the minus point is that the *SUM of AVG(Longitude)* value does not make any sense for the selected data points.

#### B) Useful information/feature in added tooltip with drag-box selection of a **single year** in line graphs

![Tooltip information for drag-box selection of a single year across event types](critique/i2b.jpg)

Similar to the drag-box selection in the map view, the user is able to view the tooltip information of the selected data points. *SUM of CNT(Sheet1)* field provides the total number of events for the selected data points, which is useful information. The sorting feature is also useful, since it is visually difficult to compare the values and sorting the data would help to see the order. The diagram below shows the output after sorting 2016 data in descending order. 

![Line graphs after clicking on the descending sort button](critique/i2c.jpg)

The sorted display of the line graphs does not have any indication that the data is sorted should the user remove the selection. To make matters worse, the difference in the y-axis range across the line graphs and the y-axis not starting at zero do not aid the user in perceiving the sorting order (ascending or descending).

#### C) Sorting feature in added tooltip not useful with drag-box selection **across years** in line graphs

If the user wants to find out more on the number of *Explosions/Remote violence* and *Violence against civilians* events between 2016 and 2018, the visualisation allows the selection and displays the sum of the events when mousing over one of the data points.

![Tooltip information for drag-box selection across years and event types](critique/i2d.jpg)
The sorting feature is also available, and the output after sorting is shown below.

![Chart type and year order change after clicking on the descending sort button](critique/i2e.jpg)

This sorting feature and its output create confusion to the user due to the following:

* Chart type changes to a bar chart: data shown is the same, but user is required to switch from perceiving lines graphs to bar graphs
* Year order for the selected years changes: order does not make sense, even when user tries to decipher from the bar graphs. The change is also subtle and might go undetected

In addition, the selection function changes to a radial selection after sorting was done, and there is no option for user to switch to other selection options on the line graphs.

![Radial selection option after clicking on the descending sort button](critique/i2f.jpg)

#### D) Filter feature is flexible

The visualisation allows user to filter the data displayed by all countries or a specific country. The map view corresponds to the filter selection, i.e. the map pans to the country that is being selected. For example, the map view pans to show the entire region when *(All)* is selected. The data in the line graphs also changes, as can be seen by the change in the y-axis range.

![Data shown in map and line graphs updates when the data is filtered by *(All)*](critique/i2g.jpg)

The filter function also allows for filtering by multiple countries, although this requires some exploration on the part of the user. Notice that the map view now pans to show the area that covers the selected countries only.

![Multiple countries filter](critique/i2h.jpg)

The multiple selection of countries is achieved by clicking on the dropdown arrow on the *Country* filter and selecting *Multiple Values (list)*, as shown below. The user can also choose to perform filter by inclusion or exclusion.

![Able to change filter parameters from the dropdown arrow in the *Country* filter](critique/i2i.jpg)

It was observed that the line graphs are designed to show total values by event types based on the country filter. This means that the line graphs do not support comparison of event types across countries, should the user want to compare between countries.

#### E) Highlighting draws attention to selected records

The highlighting feature is useful to view the data points for selected event types, especially in the map view. As seen from the diagram below, selecting *Strategic development* on the *Event Type* colour legend highlights the corresponding data points on the map and the line graph, and the other data are "greyed out". 

![Selecting *Strategic development* on Event Type legend highlights corresponding data points on map and line graph](critique/i2j.jpg)

However, as the data points on the map are opaque and overlap with each other, it is difficult to make comparison between event types on the map view (as mentioned earlier under the clarity criterion). The following diagram showing the selection of *Battles* and *Strategic development* further reinforces this difficulty.

![*Battles* data points on map cover the *Strategic development* data points on the map, as compared to previous diagram](critique/i2k.jpg)

Another point to note is that the order of the line graphs and the order of the event type legend are not aligned for *Violence against civilians*, *Protests* and *Riots* event types. This is counter-intuitive to the user in perceiving the sequence of the line graph with reference to the legend, and vice versa.

![Sequence order of line graphs differs from Event Type legend](critique/i2l.jpg)

### 3) No coordinated highlighting between the two views

Although the visualisation places the map and line graphs side-by-side, the two views are not coordinated. Selecting data points in one view does not highlight the corresponding data points in the other view. The diagram below shows the selection of all the 2016 data points in the line graphs, but the 2016 data points are not highlighted in the map view. 

![Selecting data points in line graph for 2016 does not change the display of data points in the map view ](critique/i3.jpg)
