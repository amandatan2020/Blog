    "contents": "\r\nThe Data Visualisation\r\nSource: Report: Labour Force in Singapore 2019, Ministry of Manpower(a) Critique of current visualisation\r\nClarity\r\n1. No proper labelling of graph axes and units used in table\r\nThe visualisation has a chart title and sub-title to inform the audience that the graph shows data on resident labour force by age and the units are in per cent. However, the graph itself does not have the y-axis or its title or label, which lets the audience wonder what is the y-axis measure if one misses the small print of the chart sub-title.\r\nThe x-axis should be have a title to indicate that the data is grouped into age bands. The positioning of the x-axis just above the table values also created some confusion pertaining to the unit measure of the x-axis and y-axis. Therefore, in this visualisation, it is important to have proper axis titles and unit measures.\r\n2. Intended message not clearly conveyed by visualisation\r\nLooking at the visual alone (both graph and table), the message focus seems to be on the spread across the different age bands for the years 2009 and 2019, with two reference lines indicating the median age for each aforementioned year. The lead-in statements provide more information and numbers, and possible explanations for the shift in share of the resident labour force, which resulted in the increase in median age between 2009 and 2019. The lead-in statements further grouped the age bands (“aged 55 & over”, “aged 25 to 54”) in its description, which is inconsistent with the graph display. There is also mention of the Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) and its possible relationship with the labour force age, which is not reflected in the visualisation.\r\nWith reference to the original report on page 22, the entire visualisation and lead-in statements served to describe the trend that there are “more older residents in the labour force”. This message is not clearly conveyed by the visualisation and is only explicitly mentioned at the end of the lead-in statements.\r\nWhen put together, the audience is overwhelmed by the information provided in the lead-in statements and underwhelmed by the graph with no annotations to highlight the trends. Effective visualisations should work the other way round, where the lead-in statements should set the context and background succinctly, and the visualisation should convey the data and the intended message in a concise manner.\r\n3. Use of line chart with categorical data plotted on the x-axis\r\nLine charts are frequently used to display time-series data, with the time factor plotted on the x-axis. In this visualisation, data is plotted for two time periods (2009 and 2019) but are represented as two series on the chart area instead, with the age band categories indicated on the x-axis. The use of wrong chart type led to some initial confusion on what the graph is trying to convey.\r\n4. Labour force age patterns between 2009 and 2019 were not shown\r\nThe data for the years between 2009 and 2019 were not plotted on the graph, which diminishes the clarity of the visualisation. Questions on the integrity of the visualisation may also arise, such as whether the visualisation is trying to show what it wants the audience to see, or to hide certain trends that happened during those missing years.\r\n5. Data source and note on data values included in the visualisation\r\nIndicating the data source gives credibility to the visualisation and allows the audience to look into the data source in more detail. Adding a note to explain the rounding implication on summation of percentages is helpful to avoid questions from the more meticulous and detailed audience. The note also hinted that the data values shown are in percentages. The aesthetics could be further improved by aligning the two lines of text.\r\nAesthetics\r\n1. Clear differentiation between data lines and reference lines\r\nThe audience is able to quickly differentiate the data from the reference lines, as the data is made more obvious by using thicker lines and the reference lines are thinner and dotted.\r\n2. Well-placed labels on visualisation allows audience to identify groups of data\r\nThe visualisation has well-placed labels to differentiate between 2009 and 2019 for each data visualisation, namely the line graphs, reference lines and table values. This eliminated the need for a legend as the audience can immediately know the year represented by which line. In addition, the label for the median reference line included the median value, giving the audience the information upfront without having the need to trace the reference line to the x-axis to look for the median age.\r\nThe labels can be further improved by removing the word “June”, as the intended message is concerned with the age over a longer period of time (in years), and does not require the exact month that the data is based on.\r\n3. Consistent use of colours allows audience to distinguish groups of data\r\nThe visualisation defined a unique mapping between the data for each year and colour (grey for June 2009; blue for June 2019). This colour scheme is used consistently across the line graphs, reference lines and table, which makes it easier for the audience to locate and make comparisons in the visualisation. The colour palette used is kept simple, which makes the design of the visualisation clean and pleasant to look at.\r\n4. Use of background colour to highlight different parts of the visualisation\r\nThe change in background colour allows the audience to identify different parts of the visualisation. The audience is able to quickly see that the line graph elements are on the light grey background, whereas the table elements are on a dark-coloured background.\r\nThere is good contrast between the line graph and table. However, the attention of the audience is drawn to the table due to its darker colours. The background colour of the table can be improved by using lighter shades.\r\n(b) Proposed design\r\nSketch of proposed designThe proposed design attempts to convey the message that there are more older residents in the labour force more visually, while upholding the visualisation principles and best practices. The advantages of the proposed design are as follows:\r\nInformation in the original lead-in statements are represented graphically as much as possible, thus reducing the amount of text in the lead-in statements.\r\nTime factor is plotted on the x-axis with the appropriate use of stacked bar charts to visually differentiate between age bands.\r\nAs there are 12 age bands, logical grouping of age bands according to Singapore’s context helps to reduce the complexity of the visualisation and provide relevance to the Singaporean audience.\r\nLabour force age patterns for the entire time period from 2009 and 2019 are shown, providing a more complete story behind the data.\r\nUse of annotation to highlight and accentuate the intended message.\r\n(c) Final product of proposed visualisation\r\nThe proposed visualisation is designed using Tableau and uploaded on Tableau Public. The link can be found here.\r\n(d) Step-by-step description to prepare the final product\r\n1. Verify data source of original visualisation\r\nRaw data for number of residents by age bands and median age from 2009 to 2019 were found in two separate Excel files, renamed to T7 and T2 respectively. It was noted that there are multiple worksheets in T7, showing the overall number of residents by age bands and by sex.\r\n\r\n2. Import relevant data tables into Tableau\r\nThe two Excel files were imported as separate data sources, shown in the figure below. \r\nThe table containing the overall number of residents is found in T7_T worksheet. Both tables T7_T and T2 were connected as table datas in Tableau.\r\n3. Prepare and clean the data\r\nMany null values were detected by Tableau after import, as the data tables in the Excel files were formatted for easy reading and reporting. The figure below shows T7_T after importing in Tableau. \r\nThe Tableau function Data Interpreter was used for the initial data cleaning. The figures below show the resulting tables after using Data Interpreter. \r\nThe table below shows the changes made to the respective tables:\r\nFor T7_T\r\nFor T2\r\nHid column F1\r\nHid all other columns except for Labour Force Participation Rate (%) and Median Age of Labour Force (Years)\r\nRenamed Age (Years) 2 to Age_band\r\nRenamed June to Year and changed the data type to “Date”\r\nPivoted columns containing years\r\nRenamed Labour Force Participation Rate (%) to LFPR (%)\r\nRenamed Pivot Field Names to Year and changed the data type to “Date”\r\nRenamed Median Age of Labour Force (Years) to Median Age (Years)\r\nRenamed Pivot Field Values to No_residents\r\nAdded filter to remove empty rows\r\nAdded filter to remove the Total across age bands (null values under Age_band)\r\n\r\nLabour Force Participation Rate was retained in the data table as it was mentioned in the original visualisation. The use of the data would be explored in later steps.\r\nThe figures below show the cleaned versions of the two data tables. \r\n4. Create the stacked bar graph\r\nThe following steps were taken to create the stacked bar graph: - Using T7_T data, drag Year to “Columns”, Age_band and No_residents to “Rows”. - Click on “Show Me” and select the stacked bar chart option.\r\nSelecting stacked bar chart option under Show MeUnder SUM(No_residents) dropdown list, select “Quick Table Calculations” - “Percent of Total”, and under the same dropdown list, select “Compute Using” - “Age_band”.\r\n\r\nAt the legend, select “15 - 19” and “20 - 24”, right-click and select “Group”. A new measure Age_band (group) appears under the data list.\r\nCreating a group from the legend cardRight-click the measure Age_band (group) and select “Edit Group…”.\r\nEditing groups from the data listAt the pop-up window, create two other groups for ages between 25 to 54 and 55 and above.\r\nCreating groups for Age_bandRename the groups created to reflect the start and end ages.\r\nSort the Age_band (group) in descending order, as human perception of increasing trend is from down to up.\r\nSorting the Age_band (group) in descending order5. Add the median age line to the graph\r\nThe following steps were taken to add the median age line to the stacked bar graph: - Go to “T2 (T2)” under the data list, select Median Age (Years) and drag to the right side of the graph. - Under Marks card, SUM(Median Age (Years)) sub-card, change the display from “Bar” to “Line”.\r\nMedian Age with original axis rangeRemove the Age_band (group) and Measure Names from the SUM(Median Age (Years)) sub-card.\r\nEdit the axis and change the range to “Fixed” from 0 to 80. This is to bring the line down to within the 25 to 54 age band group to give a more accurate picture of the data. The number 80 was chosen arbitrary to represent the age of the oldest resident in the labour force, which does not fall far from the truth.\r\nMedian Age with fixed axis range6. Adding meaning to the graph\r\nWith the base graph, the next step would be to add meaning to the graph through aesthetics. The following changes are made in the Sheet view:\r\nThe colour palette of the stacked bar graph was changed to show a single-colour gradient over the three groups, so that the shift in trend is more obvious. The darker end of the colour gradient is chosen to represent older age bands, so that the attention is brought to that group.\r\nThe colour of the Median Age (Year) line was edited and markers were added. However, as the markers for the line chart are too small (unable to change the size due to limitations in the software), the display was changed from “Line” to “Circle” instead. The overall effect is better when labels and trend line were added.\r\nTitles and labels were edited for layman understanding.\r\nData source and note on the summation of percentages were added as part of the graph caption.\r\nAnnotation was added to highlight the increase and decline in share of residents for 55 and above and 25 to 54 groups respectively. Key words are in boldface and made larger to capture attention.\r\nAs the Sheet view of Tableau only catered for chart title, the title of the visualisation and lead-in statements were added to the visualisation using the Tableau Dashboard feature.\r\nA screen capture of the final product in Tableau Dashboard is shown below.\r\nFinal visualisation(e) Major observations revealed by the final product\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
